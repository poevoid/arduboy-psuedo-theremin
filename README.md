# arduboy-psuedo-theremin
Psuedo-theremin for arduboy using electrical noise input functions provided by user @BBCAC4: https://github.com/BBCAC4/Electrical-Noise-Input-for-Arduboy

I'm not the first to create something like this, however it seems the source code and hex for the older one has been lost to the ether... Unfortunate for me, who liked the program, but not for you! I did the heavy lifting of trying to figure out how they may have created something like that, found the ENIfor Arduboy repo, and strew together a little something heavily inspired by this post's code:https://arduino-er.blogspot.com/2015/04/display-waveform-on-mini-oled-with.html which draws a waveform to the display based on an analog input
